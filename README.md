# Table Topics

<h2>Description</h2>
An app that generates random Topics for improvised speeches built in Android Studio. Titles are hosted in a NoSQL Database (Firebase) and the pool of topics is expanded through community contributions. For convenience reasons, titles are organised categorically and all available themes are immediately accessible from the homescreen. The application supports audio recording of speech performances and has the text-to-speech functionality for visually impaired users. Users have the ability to rate topics after an attempt and, pending an update, will be able to receive popular topics first for a given theme. The applicaton also has a community leaderboard corresponding to the most active users, i.e users with the most complete attempts.
